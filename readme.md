Welcome to this project.
The bot is in development and documentation is not available at the moment.
If you wish to self-host it all you would need is to clone the repository and start it from `src/index.ts`.
There is a testing script that automatically converts the index typescript to javascript. To use it - `npm run dev`.
Make sure to install all the packages with `npm i`.
You must create a database and .env files in the data folder. I have left an example .env file.
The database file must be called `data.db`, the .env file should be called `.env`.
For any questions feel free to contact me.
The bot is probably alive already - https://t.me/messagesanonymbot

Check the status of the bot - https://status.iceeburr.ru
More to come soon.
Planned features: reply to questions, block users, multi-user usage, more functionals.
English, Russian and Bulgarian translations of the interface are 100% finished as I am a native speaker of all three. All others were translated using DeepL. Sorry for any missunderstandings. If you can help translate them please make a pull request, if you don't know how just contact me.
The bot encrypts and hashes user IDs in the database, this is one of the bot's policies, not collecting any data and not letting anyone collect it. In the future more features will be added which would require collection of more data and other message logs, this does not mean the policy will change. Logs are not kept, data is encrypted ALWAYS. There will NOT be ad integrations or any advertisements. This bot was not made for commercial use and none of these will be added. This is a very bare bones read me. Expect more changes soon.
